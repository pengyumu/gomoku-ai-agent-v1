Gomoku-StudentLLMAgent
A lightweight, LLM-steered Gomoku (8Ã—8) agent that combines minimal code heuristics with prompted decision rules to pick moves. It favors central control, detects immediate tactical threats/wins for prompt hints, and robustly parses the modelâ€™s JSON move with a safe fallback.

ðŸ“Œ Features
Uses qwen/qwen3-8b
Nonâ€“code-based strategy: engine does not auto-place winning/blocking moves â€” it prompts the LLM to do so
Detects immediate win (for either side) and open-three threats to guide prompts
Center-first bias for the opening and as a final fallback
Strict one-line JSON output contract with lenient parsing + safe fallback
ðŸ¤– Key functions
get_max_chain_head(board, p): Counts the longest consecutive chain for player p in four directions, starting only from chain heads.
has_open_three(board, p): Returns True if the open three exists anywhere (H/V/diagonals).
find_immediate_win(board, legal_moves, p): Returns a coordinate (r, c) if playing there creates 5 in a row (H/V/diagonals). Used for hints only.
analyze_board(game_state): Summarizes board state for strategy selection.
sorted_moves_center_first(game_state): Returns all legal moves sorted by closeness to center (used in prompt & fallback).
get_move(game_state): Orchestrates analysis â†’ prompt â†’ LLM â†’ parsing â†’ fallback to produce a final move.
